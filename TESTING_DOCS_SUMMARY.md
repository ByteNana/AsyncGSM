## How to Use This Documentation

### For Project Maintainers
1. **Create the main tracking issue** by copying UNIT_TESTING_ISSUE.md to a new GitHub issue
2. **Break down into smaller tasks** using the unit_testing.md template for specific components
3. **Reference docs/TESTING.md** when reviewing PRs with tests
4. **Track progress** using the checklists in UNIT_TESTING_ISSUE.md

### For Contributors
1. **Read docs/TESTING.md** to understand how to write tests
2. **Use the unit_testing.md template** when proposing to add tests for a component
3. **Follow the guidelines** in docs/TESTING.md when implementing tests
4. **Reference UNIT_TESTING_ISSUE.md** to see what testing work is needed

### For Issue Reporters
1. **Use bug_report.md** for bugs
2. **Use feature_request.md** for new features
3. **Use unit_testing.md** if proposing test improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Issue**: Copy UNIT_TESTING_ISSUE.md content to create a new issue on GitHub
2. **Fix Build System**: Address the FreeRTOS-Sim build issues (highest priority)
3. **Add Core Tests**: Start with AsyncGSM core functionality tests
4. **Expand Coverage**: Add tests for AsyncMqttGSM, AsyncSecureGSM, and EG915
5. **Document Progress**: Update checklists as tests are implemented

## Testing Philosophy

The AsyncGSM project follows these testing principles:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside new features
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- **Multiple Levels**: Both native unit tests and hardware integration tests
- **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass before merging
- **Maintainable Tests**: Clear, documented, and easy to update
